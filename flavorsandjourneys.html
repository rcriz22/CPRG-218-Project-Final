                    <h2>The Sweet Legacy of Leche Flan: A Filipino Classic Dessert </h2>
                
                    <p>Leche Flan is the top dessert in the Philippines. It symbolizes Filipino hospitality and love, and it is made from rich egg yolks, creamy milk, and caramelized sugar. It resembles crème caramel and caramel custard. Special occasions like celebration parties, fiestas, and Christmas dinners won’t be complete without it.</p>

                    <p> It is the all-time Filipino favorite dessert. Filipinos also love sweets. In fact, most of the Filipino recipes are sweetened. For example, if you’ve tasted the Filipino version of spaghetti at Jollibee, you’ll know what I’m talking about. I guess this love for sweets is what makes Filipino recipes unique and delicious.</p>

                    <h2>Oslob, Cebu, Philippines: Swimming with Whale Sharks</h2>

                    <p> Oslob is famous in the Philippines where you get to watch Whale Shark, it is one of the most popular activities in Cebu. Tourists get the opportunity to swim with these gentle giants, something that you would hardly find anywhere else in the world.</p>

                    <p>The experience of swimming with whale sharks is sure priceless for me and an unforgettable experience, as you get to be close to them; they are as big as a bus. Those Whale Sharks are not far in the sea, but about 50 meters from the shore. Boat guides feed them with a mix of shrimps and small fish each day. The whale sharks learned by now that they can get the food each morning at a certain spot, so they come back.</p>

                    <p>Despite their giant size, the whale sharks are harmless to humans. The maximum size of a whale shark is not known but could be as large as 60 feet.</p>
